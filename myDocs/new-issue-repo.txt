I forked both pico-ice and pico-ice-sdk on 07/25/24.
At this time I created branches test-dev in both pico-ice and pico-ice-sdk.

On 07/30/24 I noticed This branch is 88 commits behind tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice:main.
pico-ice/Docs 
_config.yml         ice_flash.md  images           pinout.md
favicon.ico         ice_fpga.md   index.md         pmods.md
Gemfile             ice_led.md    learn.md         programming_the_fpga.md
Gemfile.lock        ice_spi.md    LICENSE          programming_the_mcu.md
getting_started.md  ice_sram.md   pico_ice_sdk.md
ice_cram.md         ice_usb.md    pinout

Now pico-ice/Docs
Doxyfile             images     pmods.md
doxygen-awesome-css  index.md   programming_the_fpga.md
DoxygenLayout.xml    learn.md   programming_the_mcu.md
favicon.ico          pinout
getting_started.md   pinout.md

This repo https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice/tree/main/Docs now is missing some very important files
needed for understanding the rp2040 functions with ice40UP5K.
I believe these are missing (ice_flash.md, ice_fpga.md, ice_led.md, ice_spi.md, ice_sram.md, and ice_usb.md).

I added several files in my test-dev branch in pico-ice/myDocs.
This should have said that I was ahead of tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice:main.
