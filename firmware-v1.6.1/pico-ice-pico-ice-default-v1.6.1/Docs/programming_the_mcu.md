# Programming the RP2040

To upload a new firmware image on the PR2040 (the "pico" part of "pico-ice"), you need to switch to that RP2040 UF2 bootloader mode instead of the FPGA UF2 mode.

You can do that by connecting a jumper between the `BT` pin a `Gnd` pin, then press the `RESET` button:

1. Connect the `USB_BOOT` pin to ground. For instance with a pair of tweezers, a jumper, or an uncoated paper clip.

2. Press and release the "RESET" button. The RP2040 now bypasses its firmware, and runs the RP2040 factory bootloader (from internal ROM) instead.

3. Disconnect the `USB_BOOT` pin from ground.

4. Look for an USB drive named `RPI-RP2` and mount it, open it, and check that there are only 2 files in it: `INFO.HTML` and `INFO_UF2.TXT`.
   If you also have an `CURRENT.UF2`, this means you found the FPGA flashing interface, and need to retry steps 1 and 2.

5. Copy the `.uf2` firmware file onto the USB drive.

6. Eject the USB drive.
   At this step, the firmware should be uploaded and running.

## Troubleshooting


### RPI-RP2 is still visible after step 6

This means the device remained in "bootloader" mode.
One thing to check is that the `USB_BOOT` pin (marked `BT` on the board) is not connected to anything anymore,
then try to reset the board.
